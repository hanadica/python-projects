# python-projects
This repository contains the projects I have coded with python

Madlibs: The Ugly Duckling:
Madlibs is an interactive story that allows users to answer questions and put those inputs into a story. The story is the "Ugly Duckling", except the user gets to choose the negative attribute to replace "ugly", as well as the original animal that the "duckling" is. This project is unique because the user is not only able to choose what the duckling is originally, but can also pick what the "swan" is. 

Multiplication Game:
Multiplication Game is an interactive game that allows users to pick a difficulty and has the code pick random numbers that the user must know the product of. The code lets the user know how many times they were accurate, how many times they were wrong, and allows for users to pick how many questions they want to answer. This project is interesting because it also has an "endless mode".

Number Guessing Game:
Number Guesser is a game that has users guess a random number. The computer also picks a random number, and if the two inputs match, the user gains a point. There are different difficulties, with each difficulty having more or less options that you could guess. This project is interesting because it is not a strategic game, with chance being the most important skill.

Pokemon based Game:
Pokemon is a game that has users start of with an eevee at level 0. You then play and pick if you want to train, battle, or rest/check stats of your pokemon. This game is special because the pokemon can evolve and there is a secret boss battle at the end. You can also save your file which I thought was pretty unique.

Rock Paper Scissors Coded:
Rock Paper Scissors is the game many people know throughout childhood, but this time in a codespace. The user picks what they want to play, and then the computer responds randomly. The code counts how many times you have won, lost, and tied. The project is unique because I gave numbers the values of different plays rather than randomizing what is picked between different variables.
